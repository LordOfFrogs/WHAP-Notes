# Written Practice Test:

## MCQs:
5: geometric series, algebra error
30: Maclaurin series, forgot chain rule
77: Bubbled in wrong answer
78: Bubbled in wrong answer

## FRQs:
3a: avg rate of change, silly mistake
3d: extreme value theorem
4a: arithmetic, silly mistake
4c: silly mistake with sign analysis

# AP Classroom:

## MCQs:
15: forgot initial condition - π + 2
26: messed up function analysis, reasoning - f’(12)≠0
30: interval of convergence, flaw in reasoning - only II because r can be as big as 5
44: Taylor polynomials, needed to put in more work, construct equation - b (calculator problem)

## FRQs:

5d: Misinterpreted “amount of substance changing at increasing or decreasing rate” as first, not 2nd derivative

# Topics to Review:

-   Pay close attention to bubbling in
-   Interval of convergence
    1.  Use ratio test
    2.  Find inequality for x
    3.  Evaluate endpoints
-   Polar area: $\frac{1}{2}r^2$
-   Polar Arc length: $\int_a^b{\sqrt{(r(x))^2+(r'(x))^2}dx}$

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\int_a^{g(x)}{f(x)}{dx}=f(g(x))g'(x)

$$

$$ \text{distance} = \int_a^bv(x)dx $$

$$ |S-S_n| \le \frac{|x-c|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\text{max}|f^{(n+1)}(z)|, \text{$z$ is between $x$ and $c$} $$

## Theorems:

**Intermediate value theorem:** If f(x) is continuous on [a, b], then it passes through all values in [f(a),f(b)]

**Mean value theorem:** If f(x) is continuous and differentiable on [a, b], then there exists a value c for which $f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$

********Extreme value theorem:******** If f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b], then it has a maximum and minimum value on the interval

**Find Using:**
1.  Set f’(x)=0
2.  Evaluate f(x) at all critical points and endpoints
3.  Choose maximum and minimum value from points
