Far-sightedness
A refractive error when parallel rays are focused behind of the retina
Excessive use of muscles in eye to focus
# Anatomy
Light reflecting off object goes into cornea, gets refracted and focused by lens incorrectly, with a focus point behind the retina
![[Myopia 2023-07-17 08.51.26.excalidraw]]
# Causes
Curvature of lens
Axial - shorter eye
Index - less refractive index
Anterior - displacement of lens
Aphakia - no lens in eye
# Types
Total hyperopia - total loss of muscle contraction
Latent hyperopia
Manifest Hyperopia
# Symptoms
Poor vision
Eye strain
Inward deviation of eye
# Diagnosis
Retinoscopy
A.Scan - small ultrasound in eye
# Treatment
Glasses, contacts
## Surgery
Curving of cornea
Focus light back on retina
