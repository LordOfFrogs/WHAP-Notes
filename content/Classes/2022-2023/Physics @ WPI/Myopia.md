Near/short sightedness
A refractive error when parallel rays are focused in front of the retina
# Anatomy
Light reflecting off object goes into cornea, gets refracted and focused by lens, and ends up focusing before retina
![[Myopia 2023-07-17 08.51.26.excalidraw]]
# Origin
From Greek "muops" *(my-ops)* meaning short-sighted
# Causes
Curvature of lens
Axial - longer eye
Index - more refractive index
Anterior - displacement of lens
# Types
Congenital - from birth
Simple - 5-10 - 15-20
Pathological - hereditary, degenerative
# Symptoms
Poor vision
Eye moves out intermittently
# Diagnosis
Retinoscopy
A.Scan - small ultrasound in eye
# Treatment
Glasses, contacts
## Surgery
Flattening of cornea
Focus light back on retina
