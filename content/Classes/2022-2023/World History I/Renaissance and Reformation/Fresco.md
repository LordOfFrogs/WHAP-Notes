The traditional method of making a wall painting, popular during [[the Renaissance]]. The word means “fresh” or “cold” in Italian. The artist applied paint directly onto the surface of a freshly plastered wall. As the paint dried it became part of the wall itself. Fresco colors were soft and muted. It was difficult for the fresco artist to correct his mistakes afterwards.
