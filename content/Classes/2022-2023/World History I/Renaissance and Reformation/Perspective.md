Painters in the early 15th century observed that the angles of regular shapes, such as the rooflines of buildings, appear to converge on a single point, called the vanishing point. This effect is known as “linear perspective.”  Leonardo also noticed that colors became gradually lighter in the far distance – an effect called “aerial perspective.”
