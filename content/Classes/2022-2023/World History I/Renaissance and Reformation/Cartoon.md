A full sized drawing made in preparation for a painting, particularly for a fresco.  The cartoon was pinned to the wall to be painted, marks were usually made along the outlines of the drawing.  The artist then dusted his cartoon with charcoal, so that when it was removed the marks of the outline would be left on the wall.
