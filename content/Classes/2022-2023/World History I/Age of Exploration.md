# Causes
[[Crusades|The Crusades]] brought knowledge of rest of world
Marco Polo's journeys
[[The Renaissance]]
"God, glory, and gold" - Christian missionary zeal, excitement of discovery, and thirst for wealth
Europe launched efforts at expansion from late 13th century
# Technology
Caravel/deep-draft, round-hulled ships - sturdier ship that could sail in shallow waters and against the wind with a triangular sail
Improved metalworking techniques - allowed carrying superior weapons
Better mapmaking
Astrolabe - used to determine latitude
Magnetic compass - [[Song Dynasty]] invention
# Portugal and Spain
Leading countries in exploration
Established exploration school
**Prince Henry the Navigator** directed explorations
From 1434, Portuguese vessels searched for route to India, traveling south along African coast
In 1488, passed Cape of Good Hope
**Vasco de Gama** reached India in 1497
By 1514, reached Indonesia and China
1542 arrived in Japan and began Catholic missionary work
Spanish followed Portugal
Gained papal approval for claims over Latin America, Brazil later given to Portugal
16th century expeditions went as far north as SW US
**Ferdinand Magellan** began Spanish voyage in 1519 circumnavigating globe, allowing Spain to claim Philippines
# Northern European Expeditions
16th century initiative moved from Portugal and Spain to northern European states: Britain, Holland, France
Improved oceanic vessel design
British naval victory over Spain in 1588 left general ocean dominance to northern nations
French crossed Atlantic in 1534 and established settlements in Canada
British reached North America in 1497, began [[Colonialism|Colonization]] of east coast during 17th century
Holland competed with Portugal in SE Asia after gaining independence from Spain
French, Dutch, British traders received government-awarded monopolies on trade in new regions, acted w/o much supervision
Gained great profits, acting like independent political entities - **Dutch/British East India Company**
# Expansionism
European dominance spread in 17th and 18th centuries
British and French merchants strengthened positions as [[Mughal Empire]] began to fall apart
Britain passed legislation designed to turn holdings into dependent regions
Tariffs blocked competing cottons
India's complex economy survived but weakened
Eastern Europe joined world economy by exporting grain produced mainly by [[Feudalism|serfs]] on large estates
# Effects
Competition among Europeans
Especially Spain and Portugal
Capitalism
Mercantilism - export, don't import as much as possible
Population increase
Peasants remained mostly untouched
New labor systems
## Trade Imbalance
New economy dominated by Europeans
Spain and Portugal briefly led, but economies and banks couldn't meet new demands
England, France, and Holland established more durable dominance
Expanded manufacturing
Tariffs discouraged competition from colonies and rivals
Outside of Europe became dependent participants in world economy as producers and suppliers of low-cost raw material
Received European manufactured items in return
Africa mainly slave supplier
Some dependent regions could profit - African slave traders and rulers taxing trade could get rich, indigenous Latin American merchants satisfied food requirements
Still reliant on European imports and didn't support local economy as much, formed coercive labor system
Necessity of cheap products produced in Americas resulted in exploitation of indigenous peoples and use of slaves
Peasants forced into labor systems in Dutch East Indies and British India
## Peripheral Regions
Huge areas remained outside economy
Not affected politically or economically
Until 18th century didn't suffer from missed opportunity
East Asian civilizations didn't need European products, concentrated on consumption or regional commerce
China uninterested in international trade until end of 18th century, powerful enough to keep Europe in check
Limited trade in Portuguese Macao, European desire for Chinese items made China leading recipient of American silver
Japanese early openness to Europeans in missionary activity and military technology, quickly ended - contact prohibited from 17th-19th century
[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] India, [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Safavid Dynasty|Safavid]] Persia allowed minimal trade but concentrated internally
