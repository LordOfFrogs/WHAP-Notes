Analogous to westernization, but for Southern Asia and eventually other regions
Underway by the 5th century C.E. during Gupta Empire, and spreading to China
Spread to [[Islam]] caliphates during the 8th century
Impacted Mediterranean by 1200
Development of mathematics, spices, trade routes, southern crops such as sugar and cotton, technology
Not mentioned: metallurgy, medicine, literature
Created prosperous south from China to [[Islam]]
Francis Bacon emphasized compass, printing, gunpowder
Arguments that it was foundation of westernization - Europe didn't catch up to south by around 18th century
# Beginnings
Began as result of developments in Southern Asia in India
India gained reputation as place of marvels
## Cotton
First domesticated in Indus River Valley between 2300-1760 BCE
Sophisticated dyeing techniques
Sold to Mesopotamia
In 1st century CE, Egypt became overseas market for cotton
2nd century demand in Mediterranean and East Africa
5th century traded in Southeast Asia
Unscathed by European arrival in 16th century
Steam power used for production
## Bullion
Traced back to end of Mauryan Empire
Nomadic disturbances in Central Asia disrupted traffic between Siberia (main supply of Indian gold) and India
Indian sailors went to Malay Peninsula and Indonesia to find alternatives
Maybe led to Africa - Ethiopian merchants sought gold, India trading partners
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] geographer Cosmas Indicoplestus described Ethiopian merchants who went inland to find gold
## Indian Ocean Voyages
Indian voyages around time of Mauryan Empire knit together shores of "Southern Ocean"
Malays (people of Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines) made many voyages
Began to ride monsoons before 300 BCE, sailing to China, India
Many reached east Africa by 1st century BCE
Could be found 2/3 around the world by 400 CE
Navigated by wind and stars, cloud formations, wave patterns, etc. without compass
Balance lug sails, allowed tacking against wind
Possible prototype for Arab triangular sails
Opened up all-sea route to China (desire for silk)
By 2nd century CE, Indian merchants could go by sea to China, but took a long time
## Sugar
Around 2nd century CE, Indians discovered sugar crystallization
Disagreement about origin - New Guinea, Southeast China
Spread to India, but wasn't important to trade until crystallization
Allowed easy transport and storage
## Mathematics
Western numerals (now known as Arabic numerals) originated from Gupta Empire
Arabs call 'Hindi' numbers
Invention of 0, dating back to 499 CE
Enabled rapid and accurate calculation
# Southernization of China
Southern Asian developments began to significantly impact China after 350 CE (after Han and before [[Sui Dynasty]])
[[Post-Classical China#Religion|Rising importance of Buddhism]]
Cultural exchange between India and China
Continued under [[Tang Dynasty]] and [[Song Dynasty]]
Possibly underlaid [[Tang-Song Golden Age]]
Reformation of [[#Mathematics]]
[[#Cotton]] and indigo became established - blue-black peasant garb
[[Song Dynasty]] developed cotton canvas used as efficient sail
[[#Sugar]] became important crop
[[Tang-Song Golden Age#Agrarian Expansion|New varieties of rice]]
Began systematic terracing, water control techniques
[[Tang-Song Golden Age#Cities|Large population growth]]
Before southernization, northern China was dominant force, but shifted south ([[Song Dynasty#Decline]])
[[Sui Dynasty]] Grand Canal, even though northern capital, reliant on southern crops
[[Tang Dynasty]] strong Buddhist influence, invention of gunpowder and printing
[[Song Dynasty]] compass, allowed better sea travel
# [[Islam|Islamic]] Caliphates
[[Islam#Origins|Established initial empire]] which reached Indian frontier
Responsible for spread of many important crops to Middle East, North Africa, and [[Islam|Islamic]] Spain - [[#Sugar]], [[#cotton]], citrus
First to import large numbers of African slaves for [[#sugar]] in fields at northern end of Persian Gulf
Spread Indian [[#Mathematics]], leading to scientific advancements
Led to 'discovery' of new sources of [[#Bullion]]
By [[Abbasid Caliphate]], lots of trade with China
