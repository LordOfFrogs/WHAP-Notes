**Shintoism**, traditional polytheistic, animistic religion
# Imperial Age
By 7th and 8th centuries CE, many [[Post-Classical China|Chinese]] imports and influence
Peaked in Taika, Nara, and Heian periods
## Taika Reforms
646
Aimed at reformatting imperial administration along Chinese lines
Wanted to remake Japanese monarch into absolutist Chinese-like emperor
Struggle to master Chinese characters
Dynastic histories patterned after China
Elaborate court etiquette
Tried to master Confucian ways, admired Buddhist art ([[Post-Classical China#Religion]])
Buddhism adopted by commoners, who mixed it with kami (ancient nature spirits of Japan)
Would have represented centuries of Chinese influence on Japan
Ambition of conscripted peasant army
## Crisis at Nara, Shift to Heian
Changes necessary for [[#Taika Reforms]] resisted by aristocratic families and Buddhist monasteries
Buddhist monks grew bold and demanding, threatening to engulf throne in 760, but schemes were unveiled
The emperor established new capital at Heian, later called Kyoto
Buddhists forbidden to build monasteries in new capital, but they established them in surrounding hills ([[Post-Classical China#Anti-Buddhist Backlash]])
Abandoned [[#Taika Reforms]], restoring aristocratic families while maintaining aristocratic ranking system borrowed from China
Broke Chinese precedent by determining birth rank and restricting mobility
Abandoned peasant army, instead organizing local militias
## Heian Era
Court culture soared to new levels of refinement
World of luxury and aesthetic delights
Strict behavioral codes, constant scrutiny
Social status was everything (obsession), lots of gossip
Complex palaces and gardens, very decadent
Writing verse very valued, often on painted fans or scented paper
Simplified Chinese script for Japanese language, more distinctly Japanese
Women rivaled men as poets, artists, musicians, aesthetics, but couldn't openly pursue lovers
Expected to be as refined as men, but less involved with Chinese influence, so contributed creatively
## Decline
Rapidly shrinking imperial bureaucracy, as many were too preoccupied with luxury ([[Ibn Khaldun 3 Generations#Third Generation]])
The Fujiwara dominated imperial affairs, used wealth and influence to build large estates, competing with Buddhists
Cooperation between Buddhists and aristocrats in increasing control and lessening imperial control
Promoted by secret texts and ceremonies of esoteric Buddhism, focused on mysticism, very popular among elite
### Warrior Elites
Elite families in the provinces rose to power through land control , carving out kingdoms, dominating their mini-states
Housed in fortresses with large protections
Warrior leaders - bushi - administered law, public projects, collection of revenue
Built armies with mounted military troops known as samurai loyal only to them
By 11th and 12th centuries, violence so prevalent that samurai hired by almost all elites
Resulted in elite warrior class devoted to martial arts
Strict warrior code that stressed family honor and death rather than defeat
Ritual suicide (seppuku or hari-kari) for disgraced warriors 
Blocked development of free peasantry, became serfs bound to [[Post-Classical Europe#Feudalism|feudal]] land
Rigid class barriers, peasants turned to Buddhism
Artisans lived at court with bushi, but were of low social status
# Warrior Dominance
By 11th and 12th centuries, provincial families dominated court
Taira and Minamoto fought for dominance during 1180s Gumpei wars
Serious losses in peasantry
Minamoto victorious in 1185, established military govt. (bakufu) centered in Kamakura
Emeror and court preserved, but Minamoto and samurai held power with [[Post-Classical Europe#Feudalism|feudalism]]
## Declining Chinese Influence
Waned with imperial power
Centralized government and scholar-gentry bureaucracy did not fit with localized military leaders
Chinee Buddhism transformed into distinctly Japanese
Political uncertainty around [[Tang Dynasty#Fall]] contributed
Japanese court discontinued [[Tang Dynasty]] embassies by 838
## Breakdown of Bakufu and Age of the Warlords
Leader of Minamoto, Yoritomo, weakened regime by assassinating relatives out of fear
Death followed by struggle among bushi for power, with Hojo family soon dominating
Minamoto and emperor at Kyoto powerless
Minamoto Ashikaga Takuaji overthrew Kamakura in 14th century, establishing Ashikaga shogunate
Emperor refused to recognize new regime, so he was driven from Kyoto
Fought against Ashikaga with warlords, but were defeated
Undermined imperial and shogunate authority
Japan divided into regional territories with warlords in control
Civil war 1467-1477 between Ashikaga factions
300 small states ruled by warlords (diamyo)
# Japanese [[Feudalism]]
[[Post-Classical Europe#Feudalism|Feudalism]] developed both in Japan and western Europe because of inability to maintain central government
Political values joined together most of the system's participants
Mutual ties and obligations, embraced elite militaristic values
Western Europe stressed contractual ideas, while Japan relied on group and individual bonds
Shared [[Post-Classical Europe#Feudalism|feudal]] past possibly helped [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] development and capitalism
Contributed to imperialist expansion, war, and militarist regimes
## Hierarchy
*Emperor - son of the sun god, outside of political system*
Shogun - supreme warlord, not emperor
Daimyo - warlords become lords
Samurai - warriors and administrators, doing art
Peasants - farmers, culturally tied to land, but not by contracts
# Military Division and Social Change
Chivalrous qualities declined during 15th and 16th centuries
Warfare became scientific
Large numbers of armed peasants in daimyo armies added to common people's misery
Economic and cultural growth
Daimyos regularly collected taxes and supported public works
Incentives to settle unoccupied areas
New crops, tools, techniques
Competition to attract merchants to castle towns
New and wealthy merchant class, guilds formed by artisans and merchants
Minority of women found opportunity, but warrior class women lost status, becoming appendages of men
## Artistic Solace
[[Post-Classical China#Religion|Zen Buddhism]] maintained arts among elite
Monasteries key locations for renewed Chinese influence
Painting, architecture, gardens, tea ceremony
