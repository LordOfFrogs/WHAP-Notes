[[Sui Dynasty]], [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Song Dynasty]]
# Religion
Buddhism had taken hold in China after fall of Han
Changed as it spread to China, differing form original Buddha's teachings
Promotion Confucian scholars threatened it as well as aristocrats
Popular Buddhist sects founded by Chinese monks
Lower-middle classes followed Mahayana Buddhism - less focused on material gain and more focused on living peacefully
Elites followed Chen/Zen Buddhism - more spiritual, meditative, focused on beauty, goal of knowing ultimate wisdom
[[#Tang Dynasty]] rulers patronized Buddhism and also promoted Confucianism in govt.
Empress Wu (woman!) of [[Tang Dynasty]] massively supported Buddhism
Tried to make it state religion, commissioned art, causing Buddhism to flourish
## Anti-Buddhist Backlash
Confucians and Daoists were envious and saw Buddhism as alien
Daoist monks stressed their supposed mystic powers
Confucian scholars campaigned to convince [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] that Buddhism was a threat
Led to Emperor Wuzong restricting Buddhism, destroying shrines and monasteries
Weakened Buddhism in China
Confucianism emerged as main belief system, but Buddhism still had major influence

Extended-family households
Harsh punishments for familial insubordination
Go-betweens for complex marriage practices

### For Subset of Women
Women able to hold powerful positions (Empress Wu of [[Tang Dynasty]])

Divorce allowed, legal protection of wives
### Declining Neo-Confucian Women's Roles
[[Song Dynasty#Neo-Confucianism]] asserted male dominance
Stressed women's roles as homemaker and mother
Emphasized virginity, chastity, fidelity
Widows discouraged from remarrying
Men allowed to have premarital sex, concubines, remarriage
Attacked Buddhists for giving women alternatives
Drafted male-favored laws
#### Footbinding
Counterpart to veil in [[Islam]]
Upper class men wanted small-footed women, which spread among society
Mothers began to bind the feet of daughters as early as 5 or 6
Very painful, often debilitating, which constrained women to their roles under patriarchy
