# Rise
Nomadic herders of goats and sheep who lived off products of their animals in the steppes
Children learned to ride as soon as they could walk
Organized into tribes, divided into kin-related clans
Great confederations organized for defense or offense
Men held dominant leadership, women had influence within the family
Leaders elected by free men, gained positions through displays of courage and diplomatic skills, maintained power as long as they were successful
Since early millennia of recorded history, central Asian nomads carved out regions of power, such as regional kingdom in north China in 4th and 10th centuries CE
In early 12th century, Kabul Khan, [[Genghis Khan]]'s great-grandfather, led Mongol alliance that had won glory from defeat of attacking Jin army
After his death, alliance fell apart
[[Genghis Khan]] began to build up army and gain support

# Death of [[Genghis Khan]]
Territory divided among three sons and grandson into 4 khanates - Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate, Ilkhanate, Empire of the Great Khans/[[Yuan Dynasty]]
Third son, Ogedei, talented diplomat, chosen as grand khan, presided over Mongol conquests for nearly a decade
# Mongol Russia
Armies of Golden Horde moved westward
Invaded [[Kievan Rus'|Russia]] in 1236, but side campaign on the way to Western Europe
Batu, [[Genghis Khan]]'s grandson, defeated splintered armies one by one, razing cities
Kiev taken in 1240
Russians became vassals to the khan of the Golden Horde, lasting 2 1/2 centuries
Princes paid tribute, peasants had to meet demands from princes and Mongols - many sought protection by becoming [[Feudalism|serfs]]
Caused [[Feudalism]] to endure till 19th century
Some cities, Moscow, benefited from increased commerce
When Golden Horde declined, Moscow led [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia|Russian]] resistance
Defeated Golden Horde in 1380
Attacks by [[Timur]] broke hold
Mongols remained active in region through 15th century, but from end of 14th century, Moscow was political center
Mongol control had isolated Russia from developments in western European civilization like [[The Renaissance]] and [[The Reformation]]
# Europe
Christian western Europe initially pleased by Mongol success against [[Islam]]
Many thought the khan was Prester John - mythical rich and powerful Christian monarch whose kingdom supposedly cut off from Europe by [[Islam|Muslims]]
When Mongols moved into Hungary, western Europeans concerned
Europe escaped serious invasions because of death of Ogedei, with succession struggle causing Batu to withdraw
Satisfied with conquests in Asia and Middle East, Mongols did not return to Europe
# Assault on [[Islam|Islamic]] Heartland
Hulegu, grandson of [[Genghis Khan]] moved westward to Mesopotamia and north [[Post-Classical Africa|Africa]]
Destroyed Baghdad in 1258
With [[Abbasid Caliphate#Decline]], [[Islam]] lost central authority, civilization devastated
Mongol victory over Seljuk Turks in 1243 opened Asia Minor to conquest by [[Ottoman Empire]]
Advance halted in 1260 when Mamluks of Egypt defeated Mongols
Hulegu did not resume campaign due to threats such as conversion of khan of Golden Horde to [[Islam]]
# [[Yuan Dynasty]]
# Tolerance and Foreign Influence
Openness of Mongol rulers drew influence from many regions
[[Islam|Muslim]] lands most favored arrivals - social order just below Mongols, brought new knowledge to China
Kublai interested in all religions - Buddhists, Christians, Daoists, and [[Islam|Muslims]] all present in court
Welcomed foreign visitors - Marco Polo
