An empire rarely outlives 3 generations
Fits in with [[Conrad-Demarest Model of Empire]]
From the Muqaddimah (1300s, looking at Islamic empires)
"[[#First generation]] studies war, [[#second generation]] studies engineering, [[#third generation]] studies art"
Doesn't necessarily have to be 3 actual generations, but useful tool to analyze beginning, middle, and end of empire
# First Generation
Maintains nomadic character
Barbaric lifestyle
Brave, fierce, solidarity
Strong, conquering
# Second Generation
Turn from nomadic to settled life
They have land, power, money
Retain knowledge from [[#First Generation]]
Ease, plenty
Still fierce and proud, able to defend themselves
# Third Generation
[[#First Generation]] nomadic lifestyle forgotten
No longer honor in glory and patriotism
Addicted to luxurious pleasure
Not fierce, vulnerable to attack
