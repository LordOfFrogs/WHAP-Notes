Literally translates to "submission, the self-surrender of the believer to the will of the one, true God, Allah"
Followers of Islam called Muslims ("one who submits to the will of God")
# Origins
In the Arabian peninsula, covered by desert
Many nomads (Bedouins), but several trading towns on the Red Sea
Heavily Bedouin-influenced cities
Constant infighting among clans
Cities developed on transcontinental trading system from Mediterranean to east Asia, most important of which was Mecca
## Mecca
Founded by Umayyad clan
Site of the Ka'ba (thought to be built by Abraham)
Merchant city
## Medina
To the north
Translates to "city of the prophet"
Established on an oasis
Also traded, but less than [[#Mecca]]
Contested control by 2 Bedouin and 3 Jewish clans
## Religion
Combination of animism and polytheism
Some tribes (e.g. Quraysh) recognized supreme god Allah, but wasn't as important to daily life
Little to do with ethics
Growing dissatisfaction with old gods
Several prophets like [[Muhammad]] had already risen
## [[Muhammad]]
Influence spread from Judaism and Christianity from northern regions
Kicked out of [[#Mecca]], so went to [[#Medina]] and eventually took back [[#Mecca]]
Great military leader 
Teachings compiled into the **Hadith**
# Growth
Dar al-Islam (Influence and spread of Islam)
Jihad - Islamic holy war
## In Arabia
Much to offer for Arabs
Transcended tribal and class divisions
Distinctly Arab in origin
No intermediaries between God and individuals, unlike Judaism and Christianity
The umma - community of faithful
Gave political unity
Channeled energy from infighting outward, enabling rapid expansion
Ethical system healed rifts
Stressed dignity and equality
[[Five Pillars of Islam#3. Almsgiving aka. Zakat|Zakat]] - obligatory tax for charity
Teachings compiled into body of law
## Universality
Monotheistic
Legal codes (shariah)
Egalitarianism
Community
Accepted previous divine revelations of Judaism and Christianity, with [[Muhammad]] as the final prophet
### [[Five Pillars of Islam]]
## After [[Muhammad#Death]]
Many Bedouins renounced faith
Quarrels over succession
Muslim community found new leaders and campaigned, reuniting Arabia by 633
Powerful military spurred by courage and religious zeal allowed conquest in Mesopotamia, north [[Post-Classical Africa|Africa]], and Persia
Empire was Arab, not Islamic, led by Umayyads and other clans, with little political motivation
### Succession 
Divided opinions
Held meeting to select next **caliph** (leader)
Ali, son-in-law of [[Muhammad]] passed over because of youth
Abu Bakr selected (caliph from 632-634), one of earliest followers and closest friends
## Abu Bakr
First rightly guided caliph
Courage, warmth, wisdom
Well-versed in genealogical history of Bedouin tribes
Initially had little power and no financial support, with loose military control
Capable commanders turned back attacks on Mecca and defeated Bedouin tribes and rival prophets, known as Ridda Wars
Returned Arab tribes to Islam
Raids of north [[Post-Classical Africa|Africa]] and Middle East
With the Arab Bedouins who had migrated to Fertile Crescent, assaulted Byzantines and Persians
## Motives
Common cause and strength
Fought back against non-Arab rulers
Released energy from infighting
Promise of wealth and rewards
Not particularly want to convert others
## Weak Opponents
### Sasanian Empire
Concentrated power in autocratic empire manipulated by aristocracy
Exploitative
Zoroastrianism did not have popular support
Other religions were suppressed
Rapidly retreated and collapsed
Finally defeated in 651
### [[Byzantine Empire]]
Arabs defected from empire
Christian sects resented orthodox [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule
Heavy taxes and persecution
Exhausted by long wars with Persia
Probes made it to Egypt in 640, and took Alexandria in early 640s
War fleets created to rival [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]'s fleets
Survived for centuries, but constantly under siege and weak
# The Sunni-Shi'a (Shiite) Split
In 656, Uthman, the 3rd rightly guided caliph was murdered
Ali's supporters wanted him to be caliph, but Umayyads rejected him
Ali failed to punish assassins, so his followers and the Umayyad clan went to war
Won Battle of the Camel in 656, and most Arabs chose his side
Accepted mediation at Battle of Siffin in 657
Unsuccessful to find compromise
Mu'awiya appointed Umayyad caliph in 660, challenging Ali
Ali assassinated a year later, and Hasan renounced claims after pressure from Umayyads
Sunni's backed Umayyads and Shi'a supported Ali
Split remains today
Husayan, Ali's second son, led revolt but was killed at Karbala in 680
Shi'as resisted [[Umayyad Caliphate]] from then on

Shi'a believed caliphs must be related to [[Muhammad]]
Sunnis believed that it was only necessary to follow his teachings
# People of the Book
Aka. dhimmi
Refers to people who practice Abrahamic religions - Christians and Jews
Eventually stretched to incorporate more, such as Zoroastrians
# Gender Roles
In [[Umayyad Caliphate]],![[Umayyad Caliphate#Family and Gender]]
Women's position began to erode, not great understanding of why
Qur'an was ambiguous in this regard
[[Muhammad]] concerned about good treatment and property rights for women, but viewed them as inferior in certain laws
Argued that women were more likely to sin, like Christianity
Ancient traditions in conquered regions of patriarchy influenced change
Political centralization â†’ decline in women's rights (China, India, Greece, Middle East)
More subjection to homemaker and child bearer roles
Although Bedouin women played active roles in society, but other cultures dulled their freedom
Especially felt by upper-class women
Women secluded in the harem - forbidden area
Had to be completely veiled
Took on less responsibility as slaves did it for them
Women continued to be educated because they need to read Qur'an
They could still have property under Islamic laws
# Learning
Initially, Arabs were uneducated
As they expanded, Islamic empires encompassed centers of Hellenistic, Persian, Indian, Egyptian, and Mesopotamian knowledge and Christian and Jewish knowledge
Due to a sparse culture, Arabs accepted new ideas easily
[[Abbasid Caliphate]] made great mosques
Contributed to religious, legal, philosophical, scientific, and mathematical advances
Preserved ancient civilizations' knowledge, such as Greeks and Romans
Vast trade networks and large empires spread ideas around easily
Popularized new Arabic numerals
Built foundations of [[Scientific Revolution]]
Some developments spurred by needs of [[Five Pillars of Islam]], such as knowing where [[#Mecca]] is
