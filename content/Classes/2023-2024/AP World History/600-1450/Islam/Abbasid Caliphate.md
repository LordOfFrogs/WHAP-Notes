With allies in Shi'a [[Islam|Muslims]] and converts
**Eliminated [[Umayyad Caliphate]]**, eradicating family, except for a few that escaped to Spain and founded Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba
Eventually rejected allies, defending Sunni Islam
Chose new capital of **Baghdad**
([[Ibn Khaldun 3 Generations#Second Generation]])
Indulged in fancy **luxuries**
Lots of **bureaucracy**
Wazir - chief administrator and head of caliph's inner councils
Administrative infrastructure that allowed Abbasids to project demands for tribute throughout empire
Large size, poor communication, and collusion meant farther regions were less tightly controlled
# Conversion and Acceptance
Full **integration of converts** to [[Islam]]
Practice of dividing booty had been discarded, so mass conversions were encouraged
Mostly peaceful converts
Exempt from paying head tax, and had greater opportunities
Persians came to dominate imperial administration, causing switch from Arabic to Persian in court
# Commercial and Agrarian Expansion
Massive **economic growth** because of the increasing number of converts
Revival of **Afro-Eurasian trade** after decline of Han dynasty and Roman Empire collapse
Abbasids and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] grew **new trade routes**
Dhows - sailing vessels with lateen (triangular) sails, carried trading goods
[[Islam|Muslim]] merchants often **partnered with Christians and Jews** because they had different days of Sabbath

Rise in artisans
Unskilled labor left to slaves, who also served elite bureaucrats
Wealthy landed elite called ayan emerged in countryside
**Introduced credit**
# Decline

[[Islam]] still grew and achieved much while the empire declined
## Al-Mahdi
Early on Shi'a revolts
Taste for luxury ([[Ibn Khaldun 3 Generations#Third Generation]])
Did not give plan for succession
Barely not civil war
Successor poisoned, and [[#Harun al-Rashid]] rose
## Harun al-Rashid
Interacted with Charlemagne, dazzling him
Dependent on Persian advisors (for future caliphs too)
Death sparked civil war, which set precedent, causing people to build armies in preparation for next one
Leaders of slave mercenary armies came to control the throne
## Imperial Breakdown
Tried to control slave armies, but used funds and alienated people
Tried to establish new capitals
Spiraling taxation
Irrigation works fell to disrepair
Peasant uprisings, especially Shi'a
## Decline of Women

Defeated Byzantines, allowing settling Anatolia
Laid foundations of [[Ottoman Empire]]
## [[Crusades]]
Christian crusaders wanted to capture Holy Land
Mostly fought Turks
Caught by surprise, so first [[Crusades|crusade]] was most successful
