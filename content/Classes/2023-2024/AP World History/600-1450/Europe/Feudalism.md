Social and political side of [[Manorialism]]
System of political and military relationships
Evolved from 6th century
Military elites of landlords could afford horses and iron weapons
Greater lords provided protection to lesser lords (vassals) who in return supplied military and other services
First served local needs, but later expanded to larger regions
Rulers such as [[Charlemagne]] and later Capetian kings of France from 10th century used to evolve from regional lords to larger rulers
Feudal monarchy allowed beginning of bureaucratic administration and specialization of official functions
