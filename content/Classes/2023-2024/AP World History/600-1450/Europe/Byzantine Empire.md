Developed its own form of civilization while continuing Rome's patterns
In 4th century CE, Emperor Constantine established **Roman capital at Constantinople**
Latin originally court language, but **Greek was official spoken language** after 6th century
Benefited from the former Hellenistic world and the prosperous commerce in the region
Held off 'barbarians' and established trained civilian bureaucracy

# Emperor Justinian
6th century
Justinian tried to reconquer western Roman territory, but only briefly succeeded, losing it quickly
Failed conquest weakened empire as Slavs and Persians attacked edges, creating financial pressure
Rebuilt Constantinople with classical architecture - **Hagia Sophia** huge church
**Justinian's Code** codified Roman law, with concepts later spreading throughout Europe
# Defense to Arab Pressure
[[#Emperor Justinian]]'s successors focused on defense of eastern territory
Empire centered in Balkans and Anatolia, blended Hellenistic culture with Christianity
Withstood 7th century advance of Arab [[Islam|Muslims]], but lost some important regions along eastern Mediterranean and northern Middle Eastern heartland
Free rural population (provider of military recruits and taxes) weakened by war
Fluctuating economy
Rival to Bulgaria, but Basil II defeated and conquered in 11th century
At end of 10th century, Byzantine empire strong
# Society and Politics
Political patterns resembled earlier Chinese system of Mandate of Heaven
Emperor headed both church and state surrounded by elaborate court
Elaborate bureaucracy, trained in Hellenistic knowledge in secular school system
Similar to China, aristocrats dominated bureaucracy
Provincial governors appointed from center, system of spies to ensure loyalty, careful military organization
Troops given land in return for service, causing hereditary military leaders to develop regional power, displacing educated aristocrats
Depended on Constantinople's control of rural areas
Bureaucracy regulated food and trade prices, peasants supplied food and tax
Large urban class satisfied by low food prices
Large commercial network through Asia, [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia]], Scandinavia, western Europe, Africa
Silk production from China added to exports
Large merchant class never developed political power
Cultural life centered on secular Hellenism and Orthodox Christianity, causing little artistic creativity except in art and architecture (domed buildings, mosaics, painted icons)
# East-West Christianity Schism
Different rituals grew from Greek and Latin versions of the bible
Emperors resisted papal interference
Final break happened in 1054 over arguments over what type of bread should be used in mass and the celibacy of priests
Churches remained separate, but shared common heritage
# Influence
Spread through Balkans and southern [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia]]
In 9th century, missionaries Cyril and Methodius created Cyrillic for Slavic language, gave base for literacy in eastern Europe
Byzantines allowed local languages in church services
# Decline
Long period of decline beginning in 11th century
[[Islam|Muslim]] Turks seized almost all Asian territory, removing sources of tax and food
Never recovered from loss of army at Manzikert in 1071
Independent Slavic states appeared in Balkans
Western Europe did not help, instead sacked Constantinople on a [[Crusades|crusade]] in 1204
Small empire struggled to survive for another 2 centuries until in 1453 when [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered Constantinople
