# Two Images
Western Europe wasn't as commercially or culturally developed as other civilizations of the time ([[Post-Classical China]])
Similar political structures to more recent [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/600-1450/Asia/Japan]], Russia ([[Kievan Rus']]), and sub-Saharan [[Post-Classical Africa|Africa]]
Constant threat of incursions from [[Islam|Islamic]] world
Indications of developing society: population growth, economic productivity, political complexity, technological innovation, artistic and intellectual complexity
Development of politics, social structure
Medieval intellectual striving produced university and Gothic architecture
# Stages of Development
From 6th century - c. 900, disorder prevailed
Italy in decline after fall of Rome
Catholic church remained strong
[[Islam|Muslim]] Spain retained intellectual and economic prosperity but only later influenced Europe
Centered in **France, the Low Countries (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg), and southern and western Germany**, Britain later
Raids by Scandinavian Vikings hindered development
Intellectual diminishing, most literate Catholic monks and priests
# [[Manorialism]]
Inferior technology limited agriculture until 9th century moldboard plow and [[#Three-Field System]]
# [[Feudalism]]
William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066 and merged [[Feudalism|feudal]] techniques with centralized government
	Royal officers, sheriffs, supervised local justice
Growth of [[Feudalism|feudal]] monarchy duplicated measures followed in other centralizing societies
# The Catholic Church
For first few centuries after 500, single example of firm organization
Pope headed hierarchy based on Roman imperial model
Appointed bishops, regulated doctrine, sponsored missionary activity
Conversion of Germanic kings, such as Clovis of the Franks around 496, demonstrated power
## Monasteries
Developed monastic movement - Benedict of Nursia in Italy created most important monastic rules in 6th century
Both spiritual and secular functions
Promoted Christian unity, served as example of holy life
Improved cultivation techniques, stressed productive work, preserved Greco-Roman culture
# [[Carolingian Dynasty]]
# Post-[[Carolingian Dynasty|Carolingian]]
Weak rulers
Regional monarchies, hard to establish large political organization because of conflicting loyalty and no bureaucracy
Strong unity initially around [[#The Catholic Church]]
French, German, English, and other languages emerged - beginning of national identity
Rulers reigning in Germany and northern Italy strongest - called Holy Roman emperors, but failed to create solid monarchy
Local lords and city-states went on their way
# New Vigor
During 9th and 10th centuries
Viking incursions diminished as raiders seized territory and regional governments grew stronger
## [[Agricultural Revolution]]
### Urban Revival
Expanding towns served as regional trade centers
Rising merchant class, craft production
Need for more food led to [[Colonialism|colonization]]
Demand labor resulted in nicer conditions for serfs
Increased spread of literacy, revitalized popular culture, stimulated religious life
### Intellectual Revival
By 11th century, cathedral schools evolved into universities
Studied medicine, law, later theology and philosophy
Art and architecture reached new peaks
# Limited Government
Stronger monarchies didn't develop evenly
West remained politically divided
Holy Roman Empire's territories controlled by local lords and city-states
Pope ruled in central Italy
Regional units in Low Countries
In strong [[Feudalism|feudal]] monarchies, power limited by [[#The Catholic Church]], aristocratic military strength, and [[#Urban Revival]]
King John of England in 1215 forced to recognize [[Feudalism|feudal]] rights in **Magna Carta**
Parliaments emerged in Catalonia in 1000, England in 1265 (could rule on taxation and related policy)
Most members of society not represented in parliaments, but beginning of representative democracy not present elsewhere
European rulers made progress advancing central authority
Weakness demonstrated by local wars turning into large conflicts, such as the Hundred Years War of 14th century between England and France
# Expansionism
Ongoing political and economic changes spurred European expansion
From 11th century, Germanic knights and agricultural settlers changed population and environmental balance in east Germany and Poland
Small Christian states in 10th century began to reconquer Iberian Peninsula from [[Islam|Muslim]] control
Viking voyagers crossed Atlantic to Iceland, Greenland, Canada
## [[Crusades|The Crusades]]
# Religious Reform
[[#The Catholic Church]] went through several declines and renewal
Wealth and power often caused officials to become preoccupied with secular matters
Monastic orders and popes from the 11th century worked to reform church
Leaders, such as St. Francis and St. Clare, purified monastic orders and gave new spiritual vigor
Pope Gregory VII attempted to free church from secular interference by decreeing priests must not marry and bishops can't be appointed by the state
Independent church courts developed to rule on religious concerns
[[#Urban Revival]] encouraged forming lay groups - cults of Virgin Mary and sundry saints demonstrated need for intermediaries between people and God
Pagan practices endured and blended into Christianity
Foundations of [[The Reformation]]
# High Middle Ages
Postclassical Western civilization reached a high point during the 12th and 13th centuries
Creative tensions among [[Feudalism|feudal]] political reforms, emerging monarchies, and the authority of the church produced major changes
Christianity clearest unifying cultural element in western Europe even though it changed as Europe matured
# Theology
Assimilation of faith and reason
Before 1000, some church members had attempted to preserve and interpret ideas of earlier thinkers, especially Aristotle and Augustine
Efforts produced fuller understanding of the past, particularly #philosophy, rhetoric, logic
After 1000, process went to new levels
Absolute faith in God's word stressed, but held that human reason contributed to understanding religion and natural order
Peter Abelard in 12th century Paris used logic to demonstrate contradictions in doctrine
Many church leaders opposed such and emphasized role of faith
St. Bernard of Clairvaux challenged Abelard and stressed importance of union with God
Debates matched similar tensions in [[Islam]] concerning #philosophy and science
Increasing efforts to bridge gap
By 12th century, debate flourished in universities, opening intellectual avenues
In contrast, [[Post-Classical China]] only followed a single path (Confucianism kinda)
European universities produced clerical and state bureaucrats, motivated thirst for knowledge
By 13th century, Western thinkers created synthesis of medieval learning
**St. Thomas Aquinas** of Paris in *Summas* held that faith came first and reason allowed greater understanding of natural order, moral law, and nature of God
Scholasticism deteriorated after Thomas, but opened new paths for understanding
Medieval philosophy didn't encourage science, but a few scholars, such as Roger Bacon, did experiments in optics and other fields
# Religion in Art and Literature
Christian art and architecture reflected both popular and formal themes
Religious ideas dominated painting, with early stiff and stylized figures changing by 14th and 15th centuries to more realistic portrayals including secular scenes
Architecture followed Roman models - Romanesque
During 11th century, Gothic style emerged - soaring spires, arched windows, great technical skill
Literature and music reflected religious interest
Latin writing dealt with #philosophy , law, and politics
Vernacular literature developed, incorporating themes from past, such as *Beowulf* and *Song of Roland*
Contemporary secular themes represented in Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales*
Courtly poets (troubadours) in 14th century southern France portrayed courtly love
# [[Commercial Revolution]]
# Gender Roles
Increasing complexity of social and economic life limited women's roles
Women's work remained vital to families
Christian emphasis on spiritual equality still important
Female monastic groups offered limited alternative to marriage
Veneration of the Virgin Mary and other female religious figures provided positive role models
Even though women less restricted than [[Islam]], still lost ground
Increasingly excluded from male-dominated organizations
By end of Middle Ages, patriarchal structures firmly established
# Decline
After 1300, postclassical Western civilization declined
Major war between England and France in 14th and 15th centuries
Sporadic fighting spread economic distress and demonstrated weaknesses of [[Feudalism|feudal]] order
[[Feudalism]] declined with [[#Urban Revival]] and [[Commercial Revolution]]
Key sources of vitality degenerated
Agriculture couldn't make up for population growth causing famine
[[The Black Death]] in 1348 and succeeding plagues
Tensions between landlord and peasants, and artisans and their employees
## Signs of Strain
Increasing challenges to medieval institutions
Land-owning aristocracy lost military role as professional armies and new weapons transformed warfare
Aristocrats retreated into ceremonial style of life emphasizing chivalry
Balance of power between church and state shifted in favor of state
Church leaders struggled to regain secular authority, lost touch with individual believers who turned away from the [[#The Catholic Church]]
Intellectual and artistic synthesis declined
Church officials became less tolerant of intellectual boldness and retreated from Aquinas' blend of rationalism and religion
Art styles became more realistic
