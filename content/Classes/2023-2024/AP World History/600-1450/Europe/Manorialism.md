Economic aspect of [[Feudalism]]
Between fall of Rome and 10th century, only local politics for the most part
System of economic and political relations between landlords and peasant laborers (**serfs**)
Serfs lived on self-sufficient agricultural estates called **manors**, agricultural workers who received some protection and administrative justice from landlords
In return, gave a portion of goods and services produced
Originated in late Roman Empire
Strengthened by lack of trade and political structures
Serfs bore many burdens, but weren't slaves, they could own houses and land and peasant villages had community and limited self-government
