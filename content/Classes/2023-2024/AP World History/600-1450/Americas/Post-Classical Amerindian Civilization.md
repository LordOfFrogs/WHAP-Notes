Isolated from other civilizations
Elaborate culture, highly developed agriculture, large urban and political units
Nonexistent common identity, very diverse
# Mesoamerica
1000-1500 CE
![[aztec_maya_inca_map_lg.gif|400]]
Collapse of Teotihuacan and abandoned Mayan cities in 8th century
Significant political and cultural changes
[[Toltec Empire]] built empire in central Mexico
[[Aztec Empire]] took over after [[Toltec Empire#Decline]]
[[Inca Empire]] rose as well
# [[Inca Empire|Incas]] vs [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]]
## Similarities
**Sedentary agriculture**
Both based on long development of civilizations preceding them
Excelled in imperial and military organization
Based on intensive agriculture organized by state
Goods redistributed to groups or social classes
Transformed older kinship system into hierarchical with nobility
Nobility personnel of state
Recognized local ethnic groups and political leaders in return for loyalty
Military power less effective against nomadic frontier people
Based on conquest and exploitation of sedentary peoples
## Differences
[[Inca Empire|Incas]] tried to integrate empire as a unit
Differences result from climate and geography
Trade and markets more developed among [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]]
Metallurgy, writing systems, social definition, hierarchy
**Variations of similar patterns**
# Other Peoples
Rest of American continents occupied by many peoples living differently
Grouped according to material culture and social complexity
The [[Inca Empire|Incas]] shared many things with tribal peoples of Amazon, clans
Diversity of ancient America forces reconsideration of patterns dependent on other civilizations
Social complexity based on agriculture not necessary for fishing and hunter-gatherer societies
In Colorado and South America, practice irrigated agriculture but didn't develop states
# Population
Arguments
Mesoamerica and the Andes largest populations
Possible total of 67 million, in world population of 500 million - major segment
# Differing Cultural Patterns
Cultural patterns outside main civilization areas
Shared features with Andes and Mesoamerica, maybe serving as cultural exchange points
Central Colombia - Muisca and Tairona peoples had large sedentary agriculture-based chiefdoms with resemblances to other similar states
Amazon -  Aquatic environment served complex populous chiefdoms
Caribbean - Large populations dependent on agriculture resembling Polynesia
By 1500, agriculture diffused throughout Americas, with some combining it with hunting-gathering and fishing
Slash and burn farming caused movement of smaller societies w/o strong classes or specialization
Few nomadic herders
Around 200 languages spoken in North America
Towns of Mississippi mound builders abandoned and only a few peoples maintained patterns
In SW, Anasazi and other cliff dwellers moved to pueblos along Rio Grande and practiced irrigated agriculture
Other North American Indians hunter-gatherers, sometimes cultivating crops
In rich environments, complex social organization sometimes w/o agriculture
Differences with contemporary European and Asian societies:
- Kin based
- Communal ownership
- Material wealth not important for social rank
- Women subordinate but held political and social roles, central role in crop production
- Viewed themselves as part of ecological system, not in control of it
# Global Context
Militaristic states of [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]] weakened by 15th century
Growth disrupted by European invasions of [[Age of Exploration]] beginning in 1492
Isolation from Afro-Eurasia shows in absence of key technologies of iron working and the wheel
Small number of domesticated animals, lack of great world religion
Absence of immunity to contagious disease from Afro-Eurasia
