# Rise
Southern Andean highlands, many groups fought for control
Quechua-speaking clans (**ayllus**) around Cuzco won control, formerly under Huari
By 1438, under **Pachacuti**, began campaigns ending with control of region
Pachacuti's son, Topac Yupanqui (1471-1493) conquered Chimor and extended rule to Ecuador and Chile
Huayna Capac (1493-1527) consolidated conquest
By his death, Inca Empire (**Twantinsuyu**) stretched from Colombia to Chile, Bolivia, Argentina
9-13 million population

# Conquest and Religion
Adopted from Chimor practice of "**split inheritance**" - all of ruler's power went to successor, while wealth and land passed to male descendants for eternal support of mummy
Justified endless expansion
Social life infused with religion
Sun highest deity, ruler (**Inca**) was the god's representative on Earth
Temple of the Sun at Cuzco center of state religion
Sun cult spread throughout empire, but worship of local gods continued
Popular belief based on profound animism, endowed nature with spiritual power
Prayers and sacrifices offered at holy shrines (huacas), organized into groupings under authority of ayllus
Temples served by priests and women dedicated to preparing sacrifices, managing festivals and celebrations
# Imperial Rule
Inca, considered virtually a god, ruled from Cuzco
Also site of major temple
Divided into four provinces with governors
Bureaucracy in which most nobility served
Local rulers (curacas) continued in office in return for loyalty
Exempt from tribute and received labor or produce from subjects, sons educated in Cuzco
Quechua language, use of colonists (mitmaqs), and forced transfer of peoples integrated empire
Complex system of roads, bridges, causeways, way stations (tambos), storehouses helped military movement
Conquered peoples supplied land and labor (**mita**)
Served in military and received rewards from new conquest
Inca state organized building and irrigation projects beyond capabilities of subject peoples, in return, tribute and loyalty
All local resources taken and redistributed for people, state, religion
Some women taken as concubines for Inca or as temple servants
Each community controlled by ayllus and aimed at self-sufficiency
Integration of imperial policy and regional diversity was achievement
Reciprocity allowed efficient function
Nobility had privileges and distinguished by dress and custom
No distinct merchant class because of emphasis on self-sufficiency and state managed economy
# Gender Roles
Most men peasants and herders, women worked in household, wove cloth, aided agriculture
Property passed on in both lines
Ideology of complementary sexes, but emphasis on military made men dominant
Gender cooperation reflected in cosmology - gods and goddesses venerated by both sexes, but women had special feeling for moon and fertility goddesses of Earth and corn
Ruler's senior wife link to moon
Male power showed in selection of women for state and temple
# Culture
Beautiful pottery and cloth
Metallurgy among most advanced in Americas
Lacked wheel and writing system, instead using knotted strings (**quipu**) for accounts and enumeration
Peak of genius in statecraft and architecture
Constructed great stone buildings, agricultural terraces, irrigation projects, road systems
# Decline
State remained strong until lost control of subjects and government mechanisms
Royal multiple marriages used to forge alliances eventually created rival claims for power and civil war
