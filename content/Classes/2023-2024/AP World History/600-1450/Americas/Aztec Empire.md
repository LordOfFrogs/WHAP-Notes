1325-1521
# Rise
After [[Toltec Empire#Decline]],
Center of population and power shifted to valley of Mexico and its large lake chain
Dense population used water for agriculture, fishing, transportation
Became heartland of post-classical Mexico, divided politically into many small competing units
Militant Aztecs (Mexica) migrated to region during early 14th century
Initially served indigenous inhabitants as allies or mercenaries
c. 1325 founded **Tenochtitlan** and **Tlatelolco** on lake islands of Texcoco
By 1434, became dominant regional power

# Social Contract
Transformed by expansion and conquest from clans (**calpulli**) to stratified society under powerful ruler
Self-image of people chosen to serve the gods
Religious practice of human sacrifice expanded
Military class had central role as suppliers of war captives for sacrifice
Rulers used sacrifice as means of political terror
By the time of Moctezuma II, the ruler dominated state
# Religion
In Aztec religion, little distinction between world of gods and natural order
Hundreds of gods and goddesses worshipped
Polytheistic, animistic
## 3 major divisions
Gods of fertility, agricultural cycle, maize, water
Creator deities: eg. most powerful Tonatiuh, warrior god of sun, Tezcatlipoca, god of night sky
Gods of warfare and sacrifice: among them Huitzilopochtli, tribal patron - paramount deity and identified with old sun god, drew strength from human sacrifice
##
Expanded existing human sacrifice to unprecedented scale
Symbolism and ritual, including ritualistic cannibalism, accompanied sacrifices
Balance between sacrifice motivated by religion vs terror under debate
Other religious concerns besides sacrifice
Complex mythology explaining birth and history of gods and relation to humans
Religious symbolism infused in all aspects of life
Cyclical, fatalistic history - believed world had been destroyed before and would be again
# Economy
Food depended on traditional agriculture and innovations
Conquered people lost land and gave food as tribute
In and around lake, developed irrigated agriculture system
Chinampas - artificial floating islands, permitted harvesting of high-yield multiple yearly crops
Peasant production and tribute supplied basic foods
Clans in each community appointed land among people, nobles, temples
Periodic markets for exchange - great daily market at Tlatelolco controlled by merchant class (**pochtecatl**) specialized in long-distance luxury trade
State-controlled mixed economy - tribute, markets, commodities, all highly regulated
# Hierarchy
Expanding empire became increasingly hierarchical
Calpulli organization survived, but different social classes appeared
Tribute from subjects not enough to maintain population
## Widening Social Gulf
By 16th century, 7 original calpulli expanded from kinship groups to residential groupings including neighbors, allies, dependents
Performed vital local functions in distributing land, labor, maintaining temples and schools
During wars, organized military units
Governed by councils of family heads, but families not equal
Class of nobility (pipiltin) emerged from privileged families in distinguished calpulli
Nobles controlled military and priesthood
Military virtues infused all of society, linked to cult of sacrifice, justified nobility predominance
Death in battle and childbirth ensured eternal life
Social gulf between nobles and commoners widened
Social distinctions formalized by giving pipiltin special clothes and symbols of rank
Imperial family members most distinguished
New class of workers (like [[Feudalism|serfs]]) created to serve on noble private land
Held status above slaves
Scribes, artisans, healers, constituted intermediate social group in larger cities
Long-distance merchants had own calpulli, but restrictions blocked entry into nobility
# Gender Roles
Women had variety of roles
Helped in fields, but primarily in household
Skill in weaving esteemed - older trained younger
Marriages arranged, virginity important
Polygamy existed among nobles, but peasants monogamous
Women inherited and passed on property, but subordinate to men
New World technology limited development for women compared to other cultures
Absence of milling required hours of grinding maize by hand
# Tribute
Each city-state ruled by speaker chosen from nobility
Ruler of Tenochtitlan (Great Speaker) surpassed all others
Presided over elaborate court
Prime minister, usually close relative to ruler, had tremendous power
Governing council, but lacked power
During first 100 years of expansion, powerful nobility and emperor taken over authority of calpulli
Military virtues became supreme as state religion, desire for tribute and captives for sacrifice drove further conquest
Empire not integrated - defeated local rulers remained as subordinates
Left alone if tribute and labor obligations met
Revolts ruthlessly suppressed
Successful system because aimed at political domination and not direct control
# Decline
Growing social stresses created by rise of pipiltin and terror and tribute contributed to collapse
