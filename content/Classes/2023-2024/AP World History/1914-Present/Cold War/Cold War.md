Both members of UN
# Causes
- After [[World War II|WWII]]
- Disagreements over postwar territory
- Korea divided into zones
- Germany's holding divided in Europe (Berlin Wall)
- Everyone agrees that [[Imperialism]] by [[World War II#Axis Powers|Axis Powers]] was bad
# Tactics
- Focal point - Germany
	- Divided
- Conflicts in Middle East and Asia, with war in Korea and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]
- Significant changes in Asia, but mostly stalemate in Europe
- **Polarization**
	- Countries had to turn to either NATO or [[United Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]] for defense
## Proxy Wars
- Indirect wars in which one superpower fights while the other sends aid
- ([[World War II|WWII]] (weak [[Colonialism|colonial]] powers, Axis [[imperialism]] bad) + Holocaust (undermines social Darwinism) / Polarization )^[[Mutually Assured Destruction|MAD]]
## Arms Races
- Atomic weapons -> hydrogen weapons
## [[Mutually Assured Destruction]]
- Atomic bombs on Japan act as threat to [[United Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]
## Alliances
- NATO
	- North American Treaty Organization
	- US, Britain, France, Spain
	- Not always democratic (Spain), just about opposing [[United Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]
	- Not really puppet
- Warsaw Pact
	- Response to NATO
	- Warsaw - capital of Poland
		- Chosen because it makes it not look totalitarian
	- [[United Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]], generally Eastern Europe
	- More puppet-ish
## Diplomacy

## Foreign Aid
- Convince countries to be on their side
