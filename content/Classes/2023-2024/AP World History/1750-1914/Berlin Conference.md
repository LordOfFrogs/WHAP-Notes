1884
Germany new status as country (1871) wants to display
Sets rules for partition of Africa (didn't actually divide)
No African representatives (social Darwinism)
Sets borders on previously very blended populations
**Whichever country can stake and enforce a claim to a territory gets it** - done by businesses commissioned by governments
# Before
- Blended African populations
- Many different tribes dispersed about
- Struggle for limited resources
# Effects
- Unleashes government/private businesses scramble for Africa
## Borders
- Arbitrary
- Divide previously unified peoples
- Make rivals live together
	- Europeans exploit for resources
## Short-Term
Easier for Europeans to rule
## Long-Term
- With [[Decolonization]], Europeans kicked out Africa by relatively unified Africans
- Eventually, people that the Europeans gave power now face retribution from the people they oppressed (Rwanda Genocide)
- Leads to border disputes because of unnatural borders
- Civil wars
- Wars between new nations because divided populations
