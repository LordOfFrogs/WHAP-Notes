For [[complex number]] $z$:
$$
\begin{align*}
z^{n}=1\\
z^{n}=|z|^{n}e^{in\theta}
\end{align*}
$$
So [[Complex Number#Modulus|modulus]] must be 1 and [[Complex Number#Argument|argument]] must be $\frac{2\pi k}{n}$ for some integer k
$$
\implies z=e^{i(2\pi k/n)}
$$
And solutions must be evenly distributed about the complex unit circle
Also possible to solve by factoring, but really annoying
