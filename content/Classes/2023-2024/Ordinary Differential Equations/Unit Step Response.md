[[Input-Response Formulation]]
Solution of [[Ordinary Differential Equation|ODE]] with [[Laplace Transform#Special Case - Rest Initial Conditions|rest initial conditions]]
$$
p(D)[x(t)]=u(t)
$$
Where $u(t)$ is a [[Heaviside Function]]
Denoted by $v(t)$, $V(s)$ is [[Laplace Transform]]
$$
V(s)=\frac{1}{sp(s)}
$$
Also,
$$
\dot{v}(t)=w(t)
$$
Where $w(t)$ is the [[Unit Impulse Response]]
