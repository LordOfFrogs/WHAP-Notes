> Suppose $F(x,y)$ and partial derivative $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$ are continuous in some rectangle R containing $(x_{0},y_{0})=(a,b)$. For some open interval I containing a, the [[First Order ODE#Initial Value Problem (IVP)|initial value problem]] $\frac{dy}{dx}=F(x,y),y(a)=b$ has a unique solution defined on the interval I

Essentially, as long as F is continuous and differentiable, there is 1 unique solution to the [[First Order ODE#Initial Value Problem (IVP)|IVP]].
Implies that solution curves cannot cross, as that would mean that there are 2 solutions at a point
