[[Input-Response Formulation]]
Solution of [[Ordinary Differential Equation|ODE]] with [[Laplace Transform#Special Case - Rest Initial Conditions|rest initial conditions]]
$$
p(D)[x(t)]=\delta(t)
$$
Where $\delta(t)$ is [[Delta Function]]
Denote solution as $w(t)$
Its [[Laplace Transform]] $W(s)$ is called **transfer function**
$$
W(s)=\frac{1}{p(s)}
$$
