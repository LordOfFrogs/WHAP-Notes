An operation is linear if it preserves scaling and adding
Eg. differentiation, combination (addition, scaling)
$$
\begin{align*}
D[c_{1}x_{1}+c_{2}x_{2}]=c_{1}D[x_{1}]+c_{2}D[x_{2}]\\
M_{p}[c_{1}x_{1}+c_{2}x_{2}]=c_{1}M_{p}[x_{1}] + c_{2}M_{p}[x_{2}]
\end{align*}
$$
Algebraic composition and combination (addition, scaling) of linear operators is also linear
