For some [[Linear ODE|Linear]] [[Nth-Order ODE]] $T(x)=q_{1}(t)+q_{2}(t)+\cdots+q_{n}(t)$
It can be broken into multiple equations with particular solutions:
$$
\begin{align*}
T(x_{1})=q_{1}(t)\\
T(x_{2})=q_{2}(t)\\
\vdots\\
T(x_{n})=q_{n}(t)
\end{align*}
$$
Leading to the solution:
$$
x_{p}=x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}
$$
