If $f(x)$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ takes on its maximum and minimum values on this interval
To find, seek points where $f'(x)=0$ (stationary point), $f'(x)$ is undefined, and endpoints - only places max or min could occur
Stationary point could give max, min, or point of inflection
# Multivariable
If a function $f(x_{1},\cdots,x_{n})$ is continuous on a closed and bounded domain $D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $f$ must attain its max and min values somewhere in the domain
Potential max or min at:
Critical points:
1. Stationary points ($\overrightarrow{\nabla f }=\vec{0}$ [[Gradient]]=0), where all [[Partial Derivative]]s are 0 (test with [[Second Derivative Test]])
2. Non-differentiable points
Or:
1. On boundary of the domain (use [[Method of Lagrange Multipliers]])
1 and 2 are critical points
