A [[Coordinates|coordinate]] is a function that assigns numbers to points
Origin - starting point
Orientation - "direction" of system, represented in higher [[Dimension|dimensions]]
Scale(s) - constant for [[Linearity|linear]] [[Coordinates|coordinate]] systems, but could be like [[polar coordinates]]
Axes - directions that are measured
Can transform between [[coordinates]]
