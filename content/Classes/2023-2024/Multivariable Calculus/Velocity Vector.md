[[Vector]] representing change in position over time
# For [[Parameterized Curve]]
$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{v}(t)=\vec{r}'(t)=\langle x_{1}'(t),x_{2}'(t),\cdots,x'_{n}(t)\rangle
\end{align*}
$$
Instantaneous rate of change of function found by differentiation
Has to be differentiable
Tangent to the curve, unless it's 0
$\|\vec{v}(t)\|$ is speed
