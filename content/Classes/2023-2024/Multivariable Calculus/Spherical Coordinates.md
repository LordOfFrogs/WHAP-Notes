[[R3]] [[coordinate system]]
Measures distance from origin, and orientation around 2 different axes (x and z typically) with 2 angles in radians
$(\rho, \phi, \theta)$ $\phi$ is known as angle of declination, $\theta$ as azimuth
![[3D_Spherical.svg.png|400]]
To [[Cartesian coordinates]]:
$$
\left\{\begin{align*}
x=\rho \cos \theta \sin \phi \\
y=\rho \sin \theta \sin \phi \\
z=\rho \cos \phi
\end{align*}\right\}
$$
