>[!Derfinition]
>Given function $f$ at point $\vec{x}_{0}$ in the direction of [[vector#Unit Vector|unit vector]] $\hat{u}$, the directional derivative is:
>$$
>\frac{df}{ds}=(D_{\hat{u}}f)(\vec{x}_{0})=\overrightarrow{\nabla f}(\vec{x}_{0})\cdot \hat{u}
>$$
> Where $\overrightarrow{\nabla f}$ is the [[gradient]] of $f$ and $s$ is distance traveled

[[Dot Product#Orthogonal Projection|Scalar projection]] of the [[gradient]] in a given direction
[[Partial Derivative]] with respect to x or y is just the [[directional derivative]] in the x or y direction
$\|\overrightarrow{\nabla f}\|$ is the maximum rate of change of a given function per distance traveled (referred to as the **grade**)
