A [[Linear Transformation]] $T:V\to W$[^1] is isomorphic if it is one-to-one and onto its codomain. For every $g\in W$, there is a unique $f\in V$ such that $T(f)=g$

A [[linear transformation]] is isomorphic if and only if its [[matrix]] relative to suitable [[Basis|bases]] for $V$ and $W$ is an [[Matrix#Invertibility|invertible matrix]]
