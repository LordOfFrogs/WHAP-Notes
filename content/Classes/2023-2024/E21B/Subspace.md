A subspace $V$ of [[Rn]] is a subset (and [[vector space]]) that is closed under [[vector]] addition and scalar multiplication
For [[Vector|vectors]] $\vec{v}_{1},\vec{v}_{2}\in V$ and scalars $c_{1},c_{2}$, $c_{1}\vec{v}_{1}+c_{2}\vec{v}_{2}\in V$
The zero [[vector]] is in all subspaces
# Visualization
Visualized as "flat things through the origin"
In [[R2]], $\vec{v}\in V$ forms a line
In [[R3]], $\vec{v}_{1}, \vec{v}_{2}\in V$ forms a plane
Continues to [[Rn]], with higher-dimensional flat things called "affine"
