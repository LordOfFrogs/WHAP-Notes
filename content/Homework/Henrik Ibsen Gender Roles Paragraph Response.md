**What is Henrik Ibsen’s commentary on gender roles during the [[Industrial Revolution]] era?**

Henrik Ibsen critiques the constraints and harm of gender roles during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He identifies the plight of women in their restrictive roles with the character of Nora. She yearns for independence, but Torvald's infantilization prevented her from realizing her dreams. By putting Nora as the protagonist of his story, he criticizes the patriarchy's restriction on women. Specifically, he dismisses the notions that women are less capable, housewives, dependent on men, unable to work, innocent, and naïve. Ibsen believes in the right of self-determination and fighting against the patriarchy even if it means going against societal norms.
