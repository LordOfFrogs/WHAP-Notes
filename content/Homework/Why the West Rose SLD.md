# Synthesis
## Geographical/Environmental
- Attitudes towards nature - **European belief in shaping and using environment**
- Location: **Frontier society** close to New World, currents, winds on periphery so less susceptible to invasion, changes
- Location of **coal close** to transportation networks and surface
- Domestication of animals as opposed to [[Post-Classical Amerindian Civilization]]
- Climate - tropical lazy, disease areas (refuted by many)
- Nutrition
- Fertile soil
- Shape of continents (E/W vs N/S) - E/W leads to consistent growing conditions, geographic barriers
- Forest vegetation encouraged individualism and private property
- Fewer natural disasters and disease (but [[The Black Death]])
## Technology/Military
- Mastery of transport by 1780s
- **Maritime superiority** in Indian Ocean ([[Imperialism]])
- Naval technology, energy control, immune population (from disease such as [[The Black Death]])
- **Technological determinism** ([[Agricultural Revolution]])
- Agricultural innovation because no state interference as in China ([[Feudalism]])
- **But** [[Ottoman Empire]] had better weapons, European ships built in Philippines, printing in China, textiles in India, progressive economic institutions in East and European coal not influential until 19th c. and naval innovations not impact until 18th c.
- Need land saving technology met by Americas for Europe, but not for China
- Precision instruments - refined engines
- Organization of labor not technology (Capitalism)
## Class Struggle
- Cooperation between intellectuals and craftsmen in new innovations
- No caste system preventing mingling social classes
## New World
- 'Free' resources, fertile land
- Relief from ecological pressures of deforestation, overpopulation, land shortages
- [[Colonialism|Colonial]] money (silver, gold, plantations)
## Culture
- Pugnacity (warlikeness), race, religion
- Role of genius applied to science, whereas in India applied to religion/philosophy
- Rationality ([[The Renaissance]]/[[The Enlightenment]]), refuted by East also rational
- **Single hegemonic player** - domination
- Technology and science as superiority
- Private property, urbanization - freedom
- Individualism
- **European exceptionalism**
- Fewer disadvantages, commitment to history, **laissez faire**, decentralization
- Organized violence, technological military
## Demographic
- Freedom from "Malthusian crisis" (resources can't keep up with population) - non-Europeans waste resources on population growth instead of development
- **Forced labor**
- China used people not animals - labor hungry
## Political
- Not unified or integrated - more flexibility, opposed to [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] China - Pope's proclamation to ban overseas trade did nothing
- **Laissez faire**, **capitalism** (refuted)
- **Legal/civil liberties**
## Economic/Institutional
- **[[Commercial Revolution]]**
- Forced labor, slaves, stock exchanges, insurance, banking
- Development of merchant class
- Capitalism
- Entrepreneurship with coercion, exploration combined with economy
## Religion
- Judeo-Christian tradition of inquiry
- N. Europe different due to [[The Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], literacy, role of Church
## The "Other"
- Fall of east preceded rise of West
- Prior borrowings from China ([[Southernization]]?)
- **Generalizations and assumptions that are often refuted:**
	- Chinese empire overpopulated
	- India had caste system
	- [[Islam]] was pastoral
## Family
- Population growth
- Delayed marriage
- Nuclear vs. extended family - lower pop. growth, "collective capitalism" in India refutes
## Luck
# Article
Jared Diamond - *Guns, Germs, and Steel*
Two responses - something unique in European past (universal good), **nothing particularly special until ~1500, probably not until 1800**
Controversial
## David S. Landes
First response - culture
Believes Europeans invented systematic economic development
3 unique aspects of **European culture**:
1. Science developed as autonomous method of intellectual inquiry distant from social, religious, or political constraints (not necessarily rationality)
2. Values of work, initiative, investment, private property
3. Europeans were learners - borrowed from other cultures (Chinese and Middle East held back by not)
Doesn't argue that European expansion beneficial, more objective
"Stop whining and get to work"
## Critique
Undoubted ascendancy of Europe in 19th and 20th centuries less inevitable than assumed
**Not due to inherent superiority**
Almost accidental - brief, will be short lived
## James M. Blaut
Good fortune in good geography to exploit gold and silver of Americas and [[Colonialism|colonial]] trade
Critique Eurocentrism
Critiques deterministic arguments for China's passivity - if length of coastline and pluralist politics mean developments, S and SE Asia would rise
## Andre Gunder Frank
Thorough alternative explanation
### No:
Europe made little to no contribution to 19th century hegemony
Early-modern Europe not more advanced
Didn't create world economic system or capitalism
No exceptional ethnic, rational, organizational, capitalist advantages
### Yes
Result of world economic system in operation since 1400
**Structuralist**
Most of last 1000 years, center on Asia - [[Song Dynasty]]
Long-term cycles of rise and decline
1500 not dramatic milestone of new era, just inflection
3 areas of surplus production (India, China, SE Asia), 4 deficit (Americas, Japan, Africa, Europe)
Americas and Japan exported coins, Africa slaves
Europe managed exports (silver important)
Asians superior or equal in guns, ships, printing, textiles, metallurgy, transport
State had little or no influence
[[Crusades]] nothing more than effort to connect economy
"Humanocentric"
Antihumanistic
Response to [[#Zheng He]] argument - Chinese economy flourished in late [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and early [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] - population grew substantially
Disputes that Chinese approach to exploration and discovery less rational than Europe
Not launching fleets could have good reason
### [[Seven Voyages|Zheng He]]
Eunuch at Chinese court
Initiates series of ocean voyages in early 15th century
Initial treasure fleet of 317 ships up to 400 ft long
27000 crewmen - biggest assembled for single voyage until 20th century
7 major trips to Indian Ocean as far as Madagascar
Internal conflicts caused fleets destroyed, emperor banned voyages
### Europe vs China
China compact, limited coastline, but Europe has lots of coast
China centralized, not possible in Europe, allowed ban of ship-building >2 masts
Confucianism contrasts with aggressive, monotheistic Christianity
China believed they were center of world, Europeans didn't and saw competition
Merchant inferior in China
Chinese emperor "Son of Heaven", King of Portugal "Lord of Conquest, Navigation, and Commerce of Ethiopia, Asia, Persia, and India"
China still had European economic ideas
Hemp-spinning machines in N China
**Capitalist modes of behavior never became widespread**
## Gender Roles
European women married later
Women worked as wage earners between puberty and marriage - individuals
Chinese women considered part of family less like individuals, cheap female labor unavailable
