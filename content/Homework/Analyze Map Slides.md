# Map 1
Very old
Clay tablet
Star map
Maybe Cuneiform?
Cracks
Probably created in Ancient Mesopotamia - Sumer?
# Map 2
Same star shape as [[#Map 1]]
Seems to be of Mesopotamia
Has Babylon, Assyria
Surrounded by a river (Tigris and Euphrates?)
Points of star labeled as islands
Stars outside, think this is the whole world?
Looks like modern representation of [[#Map 1]]
Probably created in the 1900s but based off of older map
# Map 3
Low res, hard to make out detail
In 2 halves
Red=river? road?
Dark blue = water
Larger blue to the left = Mediterranean?
Circles and lines - figures?
Created in China?
# Map 4
Same as [[#Map 3]], but rotated
Connection of Africa - Eurasia?
Maybe Chinese origin? (looks similar to Chinese paintings somewhat)
Divide is equator?
Therefore, probably represents the whole world 
Europe top left, Africa bottom left, Asia right?
# Map 5
Maps Asia, Europe, and Africa
Rotated 90$\degree$ counterclockwise
Something separating the 3 continents - river?
Intersection probably around Middle East
Doesn't have shapes of continents, only general areas
Printed, so originated in Europe
Seville
Reproduced in Woodward, 1975
# Map 6
Could be Greece?
Big peninsula - Greece
Smaller to left - Italy?
Multiple peninsulas with lots of small islands
Big peninsula could be the round area of China?
Small to right could be Korea
To the left could be Thailand, etc. or India
Detailed coastline, probably made later
Maybe 1500s, 1600s?
If of Greece, from Greece
If of China, from China
# Map 7
Detailed coastline
Seems to represent large region
Looks island-ish
**North America**
Shows great lakes, New England at bottom right
Mainly Canada
Large region to upper right - Greenland maybe?
Looks like there is supposed to be labels
Intricate
Probably European design
# Map 8
Same as [[#Map 7]], but rotated 180 deg
Definitely Afro-Eurasia
Top left, what I thought was New England is actually Scandinavia
What I thought was Greenland is Africa
More accurate in Europe, less accurate to the east in China and [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia]]
Africa is drawn much smaller than it is
Definitely from Europe
# Map 9
Same as [[#Map 7]] and [[#Map 8]], but traced over to form black and white outline
Still Afro-Eurasia
Now has rivers drawn in, whereas couldn't see them before
Know Earth is round maybe?
Not really defined India
Reproduced recently, 1900s?
# Map 10
The Americas
Focus on the Caribbean, where Spanish explorers mainly landed
Central America - green
South America - white-ish
North America - red
Greenland - yellow-orange
They think North America and Greenland are connected
Scaling is way off, North America is too small and Central America is too big
Reflective of region's use
Has Florida
Antarctica, India, Africa, and Europe drawn on periphery
Made during [[Age of Exploration]],  from Europe (probably Spain)
