# Classical Precedents
Continents originally devised by Greek mariners
Placed Greece at the center between Europe and Asia, later adding Libya (Africa)
Nile separated Asia and Libya, Europe and Asia separated by waterways from Aegean Sea, Black Sea, and Sea of Azof (and others)
Differing views on what continent Greece was a part of
Minimal cultural or political content
Later, Herodotus (from Rome) questioned arbitrariness and centrism
> Another thing that puzzles me is why three distinct women's names should have been given to what is really a single landmass; and why, too, the Nile and the Phasis--or, according to some, the Maeotic Tanais and the Cimmerian Strait--should have been fixed upon for the boundaries. 
\- Herodotus

In Rome, used to refer to western (Europe) and eastern (Asia) parts of the empire
## Points of note
Greek origins â†’ Greek-centric view
Primarily geographic, not cultural
Nile divided Africa and Asia
Herodotus recognized the arbitrary distinctions
Rome used to separate east and west (start of cultural significance?)
# Medieval and [[The Renaissance]]
System stood for a long time 
Reinforced in Bible 

> Noah gave each of his three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, one of the three parts of the world for their inheritance, and these were Asia, Africa, and Europe, respectively. 
\- St. Jerome

The continents were now viewed as delivered from God instead of arbitrary boundaries
During the [[Carolingian Dynasty|Carolingian]] period, Europe became more in reference to Frankish Latin Christendom
T-O maps represented Earth as a cross dividing the continents, with Nile still separating Africa and Asia
During the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], revived older continental scheme, with still little questioning
Became reference for sorting differences
Christendom more resembled Greece's Europe, but then didn't as Turks conquered
## Points of note
Unquestionableness from Biblical reinforcement
T-O map from [[Analyze Map Slides]]
Growth of continents used as cultural divisions
Continuing general unquestioning of system
# Old Worlds, New Continents
During [[Age of Exploration]], the "new world" was discovered
Took a while to accept 4 continents
Mostly accepted as 4th continent by 17th century
Called America toward end of 18th century
Cosmography was undermined by Europe, Africa, and Asia being the center of humanity
Isolation became defining feature of continental separation
## Points of note
Addition of the Americas, but not immediately accepted
Increased isolation and division amongst continents
Proof that the continental system was wrong was hard to grapple with
	Shows how the continental divide is seen as "how it is" and not questioned
# New Divisions
Subtle transformations, such as the Red Sea and Isthmus of Suez dividing Africa and Asia
Europe and Asia were tentatively divided along the Don, Volga, Kama, and Ob Rivers
Philipp-Johann Von Strahlenberg (Swedish military officer) argued that Ural Mountains were good barrier
Notion was supported by [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia|Russian]] intellectuals of [[Peter the Great]]'s Westernization program, especially Vasilii Nikitich Tatishchev
Allowed Russians to emphasize European [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia|Russian]] center, and give distance to Siberia
Ural Mountains eventually won debate, but needed some extending to south and west
Complex borders created along Ural River, Caspian Sea, and Caucasus Mountains endorsed even recently (1994 by US Dep. of State), even though Don River worked better
Definitively "non-European" peoples included in Europe with the complex border
Many people just chose to choose their own boundaries or not worry about it
Halford Mackinder argued for racial divide
> In fact, the southern boundary of Europe was and is the Sahara rather than the Mediterranean, for it is the desert land that divides the black man from the white
\- Halford Makinder
## Points of note
Refinements
Debate over Europe-Asia boundary - Ural Boundary won
Increased variance in opinions
Displays political and cultural impact of continent divisions
# The Continuing Career of the Continental Scheme
Colloquially, continent became just a large body of land or even island group
Many people reject the notion of continental divisions because of their arbitrariness
Oxford English Dictionary:
> Formerly two continents were reckoned, the Old and the New; the former comprising Europe, Asia, and Africa, which form one continuous mass of land; the latter, North and South America, forming another. These two continents are strictly islands, distinguished only by their extent. Now it is usual to reckon four or five continents, Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, North and South; the great island of Australia is sometimes reckoned as another

Both 4, 5, and 6 continents were portrayed in atlases
[[Montesquieu]] based social theories on fourfold continent scheme
Carl Ritter argued that each continent serves different human culture, and conflated race with the continents: Europe - white people, Africa - black people, Asia - yellow people, America - red people
Arnold Guyot, a Swiss scholar, introduced Ritter's continents to the US
He argued that through this scheme, Europe was superior
The continents were, over time, recognized as geographical realities rather than human constructs
## Points of note
Disagreement on the # of continents
Racial and cultural divisions created - European superiority
Arbitrary human construction obscured
Emphasis on geographical realities obscures the arbitrary nature and discourages questioning
# Into the 20th Century
Problems with categorizing SE Asia, Australia, and Oceania
By mid 19th century, Australia was commonly represented as separate
Many textbooks were structured around continental model
Some people recognized the arbitrary foundations of continents
North and South America remained combined until [[World War II|WWII]], representative of its Western Hemispheric domination ideas
Antarctica was added around 1950s, and Oceania was replaced with Australia
The 7-continent system is what we use today, but as it emerged, professionals began to abandon it
The "world island" (Afro-Eurasia) continues to be discounted
## Points of note
Categorization of Australia was challenging
Used commonly in textbooks
Modern 7-continent system used in America created
North-South America distinction used during [[World War II|WWII]] and Cold War as form of nationalism - America has its own continent (we don't talk about Canada or Central America)
Many modern geographers recognize the arbitrary nature of the continents
Many people forget that Afro-Eurasia is one landmass
