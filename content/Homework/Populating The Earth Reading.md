As classical era ended, political disorder, large migration
Civilization grew and redistributed ([[Islam#Growth]])
Interrupted by [[The Black Death|Black Death]]
Resumed by 1450, leading to new cultures and political systems
China and western Europe had thriving economies on opposite ends of Eurasia
Traded with Silk Roads or by sea, facilitated by [[Islam|Muslim]] merchants
Biological homogenization (diffusion)
# Disease and Migration
Central and eastern Europe were overcrowded
Demographic low-pressure zone in western Europe
Huns westward migration
Invasion of huge numbers of Goths
## [[The Black Death|Plague]]
Justinian [[The Black Death|plague]] in 542 hit Constantinople, with following outbreaks to 750
Reappeared as [[The Black Death|Black Death]] later
Originated in great African lakes district
Spread to Alexandria, Palestine, Syria, and urban centers around Mediterranean
Carried by rat fleas that can live on humans
Worldwide around 6th - 14th centuries
### Consequences
Northern Europe spared, so population grew
Germanic populations changed linguistic and ethnic culture of NW Europe
Same with Slavic [[Colonialism|colonization]] of Balkans
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and Sassanian empires weak to [[Islam#Growth]]
[[The Black Death|Plague]] also spread among [[Islam|Muslim]] ranks and [[Umayyad Caliphate]]
Population decline and migration in China
Waves of barbarians in the north
Smallpox spread in China
Chinese migrated far and often to north and mostly south
# Populations Diverge
700-1330
Epidemic waves, civil wars, political and economic collapse, barbarian invasions reduced Classical populations
Low-pressure zones pulled migrants
Europe and East Asia cycle of growth
Mesopotamia and Egypt stagnated and declined
Nile valley, North Africa reached demographic limit
Middle East modestly grew under [[Abbasid Caliphate]]
Urban populations grew as trade revived
[[Abbasid Caliphate#Decline]] and eventually [[The Mongols|Mongol]] invasions
Arabs created and sustained chain of compatible states in Dar al-[[Islam]]
## India
Demographics unknown
Typically thought of as Gupta golden age
Some scholars think declining trade and urban life while villages and agriculture grew
Indirect evidence of plagues
Brief Hun invasion, but shut down
Political instability after Gupta end could have prevented growth
Main factor was the weather, with the monsoon season dictating whether there would be food
# Postclassical Revolutions
650-1300
Africa experienced agricultural and population growth because of iron production ("Late Iron Age")
Large-scale political territories, population increase
Agricultural or cattle-herding instead of foraging

## European Economic Revolution
([[Commercial Revolution]])
New European economy without governmental authority
Achieved by cultivating more land, opening frontier on **NW** European plain
Clearing away dense forests
No mainly European civilization until 11th century
Infighting between Germanic peoples slowed growth
Number of small urban centers which rose (Constantinople, [[Umayyad Caliphate]] - Cordoba)
### Heavy wheeled plow
Probably invented in 6th and 7th centuries
Set on wheels, pulled by 6-8 oxen
Expensive, so only a few per village
Allowed cross-plowing and reducing labor needs
With 3-field system, larger range of crops and less failure
Slow expansion at first
### Mediterranean Europe
Cropland expanded in recovery 
New crops and techniques (many from [[Islam|Muslim]] North [[Post-Classical Africa|Africa]] and Iberia)
	Web of irrigation canals
	New crops: rice, cotton, sugarcane
	Mulberries and silkworms
	Durum wheat
	Asparagus, eggplant, artichokes, apricots, cantaloupes, and citrus fruits
	Alfalfa
Population grew, but not as much as in the north
## Chinese Agricultural Revolution
Chinese economy grew promoted by empire
	Spread information
	Constructed transportation systems
	Taxation and finance

Opened **southern** frontier
Complex improvements in agricultural techniques and crops
Demanded large labor force, gave more yields → population increase
### Wet Rice
Traditionally rice was cultivated dry - slow growth, small yields
South China had a warm, semitropical environment with long growing season and monsoon rains
Made fields flat and bunded, then flooded and plowed to create bed of mud
### Soil Preparation
Moldboard plow required little power in soft, wet fields
Applied manure mixed with crop residues, river mud, and available lime
Transplanting seedlings saved seed
Weeding increased yields and achieved by draining fields when rice was ~1/2 grown
### Selective Breeding
New strains of rice
By [[Song Dynasty]], almost all older varieties were replaced
Champa rice - fast-growing, drought-resistant from central Vietnam
Different maturing rates ensured against dry spells and gave redundancy
Wheat appeared as a dry-field crop
### Hydrological technologies
Complex techniques
Building dams to raise water levels above stream beds to divert water to irrigation canals
Raised water with pumps
### Manufacturing
Handicraft manufacturing and industries increased
Textile manufacturing expanded
Mulberries and silkworms grown everywhere
Tea bushes and lacquer-producing trees spread
Led iron production
Porcelain became renowned
### Transportation and Communication
Missing in Europe
[[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] governments maintained and improved roads and bridges
Water transportation through Yangtze and tributaries
Seafaring activities
[[Song Dynasty|Song]] era - golden age of cartography
Growing urban bourgeoisie population
Standardized currency
Most urbanized society of the world → most commercialized
# [[The Black Death|Black Death]]
Struck [[The Mongols|Mongol]] travelers first, spread to China and Europe
1/3-1/2 of Europeans died
Remained endemic for next 3 centuries, with some outbreaks
China's population fell by half
Relatively small compared to Native American deaths
No drastic restructuring of civilization
Recovered mostly by 1500
# Conclusion
Populations increased
Geographical range of civilization expanded
Assimilated many peoples
Inner Asia too loosely organized to form centralized states
Flora, fauna, diseases, people, ideas spread and diffused
Greater exchange between East and West
