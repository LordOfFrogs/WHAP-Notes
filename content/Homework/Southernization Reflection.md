**Write about how understanding [[Southernization]] helps our understanding of the time period from 600-1450 (post-classical)**

Understanding [[Southernization]] aids in understanding the time period from 600-1450 by providing an alternate perspective to view regions neglected by the western lens. The global south played a crucial role in the development of civilization in the post-classical era, but a Euro-centric perspective often neglects its contributions. [[Post-Classical China]], its surrounding regions of [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/600-1450/Asia/Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Vietnam]], Southeast Asia, India, and the [[Islam|Islamic]] Caliphates drove civilization during this time, and [[Southernization]] emphasizes their contributions. Viewing the post-classical period through [[Southernization]], patterns of the interconnection of regions and the spread of new ideas emerge. Oftentimes, the western lens will only focus on how these regions affected the west, namely with how [[Islam]] transmitted ideas, but [[Southernization]] also points out the developments that spawned from these regions and the impact they had. 

Major technological advancements include the invention of the compass, gunpowder, and moveable-type printing in the [[Tang-Song Golden Age]], as well as sugar crystallization, cotton cultivation, and the modern decimal numeral system from India. The Malays from Southeast Asia connected all these ideas through sea travel all across the Indian Ocean. [[Post-Classical China]] and [[Islam|Islamic]] caliphates bolstered the spread and development of technological, artistic, agricultural, and cultural ideas, with Arabs spreading them to the Mediterranean, Europe, and Africa.

While Europe did develop during the Post-Classical era, the center of civilization roughly centered on what would become the global south. [[Southernization]] highlights the global south's often dismissed influence on and generation of the flourishing of the founding ideas of the European [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] and [[The Enlightenment]]. It provides a contrast with the relative stagnation of Europe after the collapse of the Roman empire by illustrating the growth of other regions.
