**Question: To what extent is [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia#Catherine the Great|Catherine the Great's]] statement an [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] document?**

[[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia#Catherine the Great|Catherine the Great's]] statement is an [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] document in the sense that it incorporates [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of natural rights and freedom, but it also runs counter to the general democratic trend of [[the Enlightenment]], instead promoting absolutism, especially the ideas of [[Thomas Hobbes]]. She proclaims [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values of [[John Locke]]'s natural rights, stating that the government should protect the people's rights and prevent oppression. Catherine also emphasizes rationality, a central theme of [[the Enlightenment]]. Despite her support of some of [[the Enlightenment]]'s ideas, Catherine also supports absolute monarchy. While absolutism was not absent from [[the Enlightenment]], particularly in the works of [[Thomas Hobbes]], generally, [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers promoted democracy and condemned absolute power. In this sense, [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia#Catherine the Great|Catherine the Great]] co-opts the ideas of natural rights and liberty by claiming that monarchy has the best chance of protecting them, while most other [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers disagree. Much of this likely comes from a desire to align [[Classes/2023-2024/AP World History/1450-1750/Russia/Russia]] with Europe because of European advancements during this period, while also wanting to maintain her power.
