# 5 characteristics
Good general guideposts, but bad at formal definition
Formal definition not possible
Some things are more of a civilization than others
## Advanced cities
Ok, how advanced? what is 'advanced'?
Large infrastructure, population, etc.
## Specialized workers
Ok, how specialized? what is specialization? what is a worker?
People perform tasks that they specifically have a mastery/skill in
Opposed to general 'doing' of hunter-gatherer society
## Complex institutions 
Complex? institutions?
Social organization and groups that have power
Complex meaning developed with intent and purpose
## Record keeping
What forms count as keeping? oral, or does it have to be written?
The process of storing information in a form meant to be used in the future
## Advanced technology
What constitutes as advanced? technology?
Things developed from knowledge that aid in some way
# Prompt
Explore the idea of civilization. 
Which criteria do you think are necessary to have a civilization? 
Can any of the above criteria be removed? 
Should any additional criteria be added? 
Specifically, does a society have to be linked to a larger “world system” in order to qualify as a civilization. 
Is the concept of civilization itself a valid concept?
# General ideas
**Civilization is a social/cultural construct**
Designed to differentiate on a multi-dimensional spectrum, which isn't possible
# Structure
## Intro
### Contextualization
First civilizations in Mesopotamia
Major civilizations: Persians, Egypt, China, Americas, Greece, Rome, [[The Mongols|Mongols]]
Introduce 5 characteristics
### Thesis
Despite the utility of the five characteristics of civilization, defining civilization differently also proves useful, even though the concept of civilization is a flawed cultural construct. 
## DI 1 - Defining, exploring the 5 characteristics
Define and explore each characteristic like in [[#5 characteristics]]
Use to create working definition of civilization
Some can be removed to an extent e.g. record keeping, because it is a spectrum
(E.g. Amerindian civilizations)
## DI 2 - My definition of civilization
[[#5 characteristics]] exist within it
**Organization**
Of:
- Physical buildings and infrastructure
- Skills and working
- Power and people into structures (intentional social structures)
- Information
- Knowledge into useful tools
But also:
- Economy
- Beliefs
- A collective identity between people who don't personally know each other
Still on spectrum from less organized → more organized, but more focused and concise
Doesn't necessarily have to be linked to a larger "world system" in order to qualify as a civilization
Can be missing some elements and still work, for example Greece didn't have strong collective identity, but still civilization
## DI 3 - The general idea of civilization
**Social construct**
Can be useful, showing how humanity grows over time
Specific aspects, such as [[#5 characteristics]], can be useful in comparisons
"Civilization" is valid in the sense it is useful, but it isn't a reality; it's constructed
Should not be taken as reality, because that can lead to harmful ideas because of the concealment of the subjectivity of categorization
Has been used to justify [[Colonialism]], ethnocentrism, etc.
