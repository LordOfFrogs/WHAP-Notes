[[United Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]
# Was [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] a hero or a villain for the [[United Soviet Socialist Republics|Russian]] people?
While Stalin promoted projects for the public good, he also distorted the goals of [[Carl Marx|communism]], killing millions in his attempts to maintain absolute control. He instituted successful programs to improve public education and literacy, which opened up many opportunities to previously illiterate workers. Despite struggling with famine, food levels did eventually recover so that people had enough to eat. Stalin also promoted ideals of gender and class equality, and he abolished many exploitative capitalistic hierarchies. The newly educated workforce led to a booming industrial economy. Despite his positive impacts, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] ultimately proved a cruel dictator. While he reduced capitalist exploitation, he replaced it with his own. Millions died in work camps, prosecuted for the slightest hint of opposition. His efforts to collectivize agriculture took land and resources from many peasants, leading to horrible famines. Although [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] expanded the [[United Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]'s economy with public education and infrastructure and promoted egalitarian ideas, he ultimately devastated millions of lives with his oppressive [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] rule.
