## Topic: A life lesson I have learned is to make time for those I love
## Message/Theme: It is important to make time for loved ones

### Opening
Everyone has neglected one aspect of their life in favor of another at one point. Whether it was not spending time with friends because you were so focused on a sport, or spending time with one person at the expense of others, we have all done it. I have learned that to balance relationships and activities, it is necessary to communicate with others, make a plan, and stick to the plan.
### Communication
I'm sure you have heard it a thousand times, but that is because it is true. Communication is key. You need to communicate with people you care about and discuss your and their needs. I learned this during this year's robotics season. The team had not nearly prepared enough for the competitions, so in the weeks leading up to them, it was utter madness. I was staying after school for multiple hours almost every day, and although it was exciting, I was neglecting my friends. For the first half of the season, I often forgot to reply to texts and made almost no time to see my friends, but by the second half I had improved. I communicated with friends about what was going on and made it clear why I was having difficulty seeing them.
### Plan
The next step was to make a plan. While it is okay to sometimes be busy, it should not consume your life. I made plans with those I care about to meet up and spend time together. It is hard to put aside something important to you in order to have a balance, but it is necessary. I was able to dial back the time I spent preparing for the competitions and spend more time with my friends. An important aspect of planning is to be specific. Don't just say "Yeah, we can hang out sometime"; Decide on an exact time to meet up, as it makes it so much easier for the next step: execution.
### Execution
A plan is great, but it means nothing with out execution. Just because I made plans with my friends, that doesn't solve the problem. It is difficult. Oftentimes, something comes up, but it is important to prioritize. Do you really need to spend extra time doing something on top of all the time you are already spending? The answer is almost always no. 
### Conclusion
Truly, relationships take effort. Maintaining a balance between work and life is far from trivial. It can often feel like you do not have time, but it is crucial to make time. I learned my lesson, and I urge you to as well. It will save you and others from  struggling unnecessarily.
