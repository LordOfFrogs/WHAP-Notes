[[Latin American Independence|Simón Bolívar]]
# Groups
Enlightenment influence and practice (7, 8, 9)
Cruelty and failure (1, 3)
Reflection of European inequality and white supremacy (5, 6, 7)
# Thesis
Although Simon Bolivar exemplified Enlightenment ideals with his belief in freedom and liberation, in practice, his sometimes cruel actions failed to live up to these ideals, and he perpetuated ideas of European and white supremacy, antithetical to the Enlightenment's hope of equality.
