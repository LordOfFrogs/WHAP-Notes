- Winston gets a note from Julia saying *I love you*
- He takes a while to be able to talk to her again, and when he does they plan to meet in Victory Square
- While prisoners of war are passing the square, they talk and hold hands for a little bit
- They plan to meet again, this time in the countryside
- They meet in the clearing in the woods, where they speak freely about their love and their hate of Big Brother, and have sex
- They meet again a few times over a month, mostly only exchanging a few words, but they made love once more
- They go to the clearing again once more, they discuss how Julia sees life as an opportunity to carve out a bubble of happiness, while Winston thinks of it as a pointless and hopeless endeavor. Julia disagrees with Winston's statement that they are already dead
